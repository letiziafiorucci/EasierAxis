# **EASIERAXIS**

*EasierAxis* is a python package for the determination of the optimal orientation of point
charge (PC) distributions for tripositive lanthanoid complexes.

The development of the program started with python 3.8 and therefore it is compatible
with that version. Nevertheless, it has been also tested on python 3.10. Concerning the
OS, EasierAxis has been developed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and also tested on Windows 10.
Other OSs should encounter no problems. The requirements for the code to run are very
few: *numpy* (tested on v1.22.3), *scipy* (tested on v3.5.1) and *matplotlib* (tested on v1.8.0).
The computational cost for this code is negligible.

The code is extensively commented and the implemented equations are reported in the manual,
or referenced to existing literature. For these reasons, the functions here reported
can be easily integrated by the users in their own scripts.
